# ‚Åâ Support

For a support ticket the best way is to use our intercom to directly report a ticket. If not than hop on our [support channel here](https://nada.bot/support) on telegram





## Why Use Our Human Check&#x20;

We will be running funding pools that bad actors will try to game. Not only will be verifying independent checks by different sybil providers, we will be adjusting weights based on importance, and human thresholds as addresses try to bot us in realtime. Additionally if our requirements are too strong we can adjust these to make more accesible. Most application developers and round maangers / chefs will not be monitoring all addresses that interact with their contract, rather relying on our aggregated "check"&#x20;



## U**s Vs idOS**

While their are other identity layer providers, Nada.bot is for NEAR contracts that need to use a cross contract call that is robust instead of idOS which is an SDK to be integrated into applications.&#x20;

## How We Determine Humans

On our contract we set weights and approves. Currently we are toggling based on different weights (see on [nada.bot](https://nada.bot))
