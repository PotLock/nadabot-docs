# 👨💼 For Users

## Why Would Users Be Using Nada.bot

_**In order to prove you are not a bot you need to get different “Checks” which involves going to a 3rd party, verifying with their contract, than adding that check to our global registry.**_&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Different applications like PotLock and Cplanet Contensts do cross contract calls that enforce that you are not a bot.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## What you can do

* Verify with different checks on 3rd party providers&#x20;
* Validate and get a higher score



First you login, if you don’t have a wallet than create a NEAR Wallet. If you don’t have one get one at [shard.dog/nadabot](http://shard.dog/nadabot)

{% hint style="warning" %}
_It is important to note that this account will be the one you use to build your reputation and it cant be transferred to another account, so don’t you lose this._&#x20;
{% endhint %}

You should have a human score of zero. You aim is to get past this human score through a collection of stamps/checks. Then you are to look at stamp. Most stamps should say “Get Check”. This means we have checked their contract and you are not verified.

Click on a stamp, read the instructions, then click on the get check button. This should take you to a 3rd party link where you need to connect your wallet again and then verify. Note that each verification may require gas an in instruction to load up your account with enough gas to prove this stamp.

Once you verify through the sybil provider's application, go back to the [app.nada.bot](https://app.nada.bot) homepage and refresh. There that section should now be in the **Verify** section where we now detect that you have gotten that stamp but you need to pay 0.01 N in order to add the check to our nada.bot check registry to improve your human score. Once you confirm the transaction you should then see this check in the approve section and your score to go up.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
_human threshold is subject ot change or get lower depending on bot activity, as well as weights based on perceived level of difficulty, however your status of verification doesn’t change. Say a weight for a Twitter Check by Shard.dog changes from 1->2 this means, your score will go up._
