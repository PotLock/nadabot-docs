# ðŸ”® Future

While we have many plans to align incentives between sybil providers, humans, applications to integration, and our legion of bot defenders, here are some more immediate goals and priorities.

* Support multi chain solutions by adding [idos.network](https://idos.network/)
* Add more checks, different identity solutions, patterns, account mapping, 3rd party accounts
* Implementation of NEP413 to prevent from require users to pay gas to add stamp to registry
* Integrating verification processes more natively on our application
* Incentives for cluster mapping and more dynamic thresholds and bot protection
